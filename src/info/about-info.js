    title: "About Me",
    texts: ["Hi, nice to meet you! I'm Jess, 33 years old and a career switcher hoping to make it as a Software Developer. I'm Manchester born and raised, and now a long time London resident, with a brief interlude living in sunny Barcelona last year.", "I'm friendly, humble, conscientious and hardworking. I can be a little reserved at first, just while I get comfortable with new people and new surroundings. I have a relaxed and easygoing attitude, and try not to take myself or life too seriously!"]

    id: "about-2",
    title: "Experience",
    texts: ["I have ten years experience working in financial services operations. I gained a lot of industry specific knowledge over these years, but more importantly I developed personally. My self-belief and confidence in my own abilities grew over time, as did my resilience and ability to adapt.", "It can be a fairly demanding environment to work in but I got used to juggling various tasks at once and managing tight deadlines. Luckily I have a calm temperament so wasn't too phased by the high pressure or demanding traders."]

    id: "about-3",
    title: "Time for Change",
    texts: ["Over time I became increasingly aware that banking wasn't my forever career. I never had negative feelings towards my work, but I also never had particularly positive ones. The challenge was to figure out what I would be better suited to instead!", "During the various waves of Covid, when we all had a little more time on our hands, I got stuck into a few basic courses on Codecademy. It was fun to be learning something new and it seemed to open an ideal opportunity to explore a new career path, whilst making the most of my skills and way of thinking."]
  },
  {
    id: "about-4",
    title: "The Big Leap",
    texts: ["My previous jobs have involved elements of logical thinking and problem solving, as well as a need to be fairly comfortable around tech and working with numbers. Software Development seemed to be an ideal transition, where I could use my skills and knowledge but instead direct it towards something that I found more fun and interesting.", "From there, I made the leap to leave my job and enrol in a Web Development bootcamp. I decided to fully embrace change and headed to Barcelona to do it. I wanted a little bit of instability and adventure, and to have a break from the normal routine."]
  },
  {
    id: "about-5",
    title: "Bootcamp",
    texts: ["I completed Le Wagon's Web Development bootcamp at the end of 2022. It was an intensive full-time course that spanned nine weeks. The focus was Ruby on Rails, with HTML, CSS, SQL and JavaScript also being covered too. Each day we worked through challenges with a buddy, with the culmination of the course being two group projects.", "My honest assessment of the bootcamp is that it was a truly humbling experience! Having to start again from the basics after years working within another career was tough. I had to learn to embrace regular failure as a means to making progress."]

    id: "about-6",
    title: "Post Bootcamp",
    texts: ["After completing the bootcamp, I stayed in Barcelona for another six months. I combined learning Spanish with furthering my coding knowledge, and just enjoying life in another country.", "Since coming back to London I've been focusing full-time on self-teaching, with particular focus on JavaScript, React, CSS and Tailwind. Right now I'm getting stuck into Python. I have several personal proejcts that I'm proud of, with each allowing me to put something new into practice and problem solve on the go."]

  {
    id: "about-7",
    title: "Hire Me!",
    texts: ["I keep aiming to learn a little more each day, and hope that this, combined with a positive, proactive mindset will see me land a job.", "I'm searching for an entry-level fullstack / frontend / backend role. I'm London based but flexible with location and open to remote work too.", "My goal is to find a role within an encouraging, collaborative company where I can continue to learn. I could offer a lot to a company that provides a positive learning environment and recognises future potential."]
